MNIST ("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology") is the de facto “hello world” dataset of computer vision. Since its release in 1999, this classic dataset of handwritten images has served as the basis for benchmarking classification algorithms. <br />

## Below are the projects that executed using MNIST dataset:

### 1. [Digit recognition through static Images](./MNIST_detect)

The MNIST dataset is used to recognize digits. <br />
 <br /> In this project, we will have a glimpse into how MNIST data can be used to recognize images of digits using convolutional neural networks.

The MNIST dataset is used to recognize digits. <br />

<br />The saved model is used for recognizing digits in real time using OpenCV and python through a webcam. <br />
