Face recognition is a biometric software application capable of uniquely identifying or verifying a person by comparing and analyzing patterns based on the person's facial contours. Facial recognition is mostly used for security purposes, though there is increasing interest in other areas of use.</p>

## Below are the projects that executed :

### 1. [Face recognition through static Images](./MNIST_detect)

The MNIST dataset is used to recognize digits. <br />
 <br /> In this project, we will have a glimpse into how MNIST data can be used to recognize images of digits using convolutional neural networks.

The MNIST dataset is used to recognize digits. <br />

<br />The saved model is used for recognizing digits in real time using OpenCV and python through a webcam. <br />
