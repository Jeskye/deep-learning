Face recognition is a biometric software application capable of uniquely identifying or verifying a person by comparing and analyzing patterns based on the person's facial contours. Facial recognition is mostly used for security purposes, though there is increasing interest in other areas of use.

## Below are the projects that executed :

### 1. [Face recognition through static Images](./face_recog_images)

The custom made face dataset is used to recognize faces. <br />
 <br /> In this project, we will have a glimpse into how custom made dataset can be used to recognize images of faces using convolutional neural networks.
